# blender-snow
Simple blender snow creation addon. Create a snowy surface with footprints etc.<br>
REQUIRES TKINTER AND PIL. They were removed from blender. Try to install them yourself. Also, blender 2.78 on raspberrypi supports them and is used to test an addon.
# the method
This method came from Andrew Price and Guilherme Henrique https://www.blenderguru.com/tutorials/make-snow. Make snow in a minute, not in an hour! Sorry, but you also have less control on what's going then.
# install and use
Install tkinter and PIL for blender (I don't know how), download a 'make snow.zip' file from the repository and install it as usual addon.<br>
Go to the 'create' panel on your tool shelf, scroll down to a 'Add snow'. Play around with parameters (lower the "outline" to 3 if you need), click on "Add some snow" and draw needed footprints etc. with the tools, provided in the window. Close the window when finished and wait for your snow to appear!
